There are a few things you can do to help reduce the appearance of forehead wrinkles. First, you can try using a topical retinoid cream, which can help to boost collagen production and improve skin elasticity. You can also use a hyaluronic acid serum to help hydrate and plump the skin. Finally, be sure to protect your skin from the sun by using a sunscreen with at least SPF 30.
