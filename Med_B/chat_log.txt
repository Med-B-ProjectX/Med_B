You: Which food have more protien content
SnowWhite: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the amount of protein in food can vary depending on the type of food and its preparation. However, some foods that are generally high in protein include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and dairy products.
